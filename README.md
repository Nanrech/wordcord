# Wordcord
A WIP bot that aims to recreate the wordle experience through your Discord chat
 
UPDATE 11/05/2024
This repo is now public as an archive. However, I cannot guarantee this will work or that it'll be any good. It obviously uses a very outdated version of interactions.py, and I created it a long time ago, so it will likely be outdated/non-functional/bad.
